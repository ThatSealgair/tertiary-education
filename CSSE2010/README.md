# CSSE2010: Introduction to Computer Systems

Taken first semester of my second year.

I have been given permission to upload my solution to the first assignment. The second assignment was to make Teeko run on a AVR microcontroller. As we were provided much of the foundational code for this, I will be recreating my solution using a Raspberry Pi Pico. I need to get an LED Matrix first, however.
